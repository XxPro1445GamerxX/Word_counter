Requirements:

You need a text file within the same folder/file called 'Test' and it has to be a txt file

No moduels needed 

Also tells the ammount of lines within the file

Possible Issues:

Make sure the file is Test.txt

If you wish for the file to be a diffrent name, you just need to switch the first line's variable called text_file.

Make in python 3.7.3.
